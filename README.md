Mosquitoes are becoming more problematic due to global warming, spreading of species which are active during the day and insecticide resistance.

# Mission

This open project documents practical ways of eradicating mosquitoes from open-air areas. We also hope to spur discussion to invent DYI, "open source" effective solutions.

To improve this guide, make pull requests or report an issue.


# Solutions

In order of practicality (cost, availability, effectiveness, damage to ecosystem)

## Bacteria eating larvae

â€ŽBacillus Thuringiensis Sub-Species Israelensis, placed in water used to lay eggs.

## [Traps](https://github.com/mariusa/mosquito-eradication/wiki/Traps)


## [Sterilisation](https://github.com/mariusa/mosquito-eradication/wiki/Sterilisation)



## [Genetic modifications](https://github.com/mariusa/mosquito-eradication/wiki/Genetic-modifications)



## [Laser Insect Monitoring and Eradication](https://github.com/mariusa/mosquito-eradication/wiki/Laser-Insect-Monitoring-and-Eradication)


## Insecticides

While these work, insecticides are harmful to other insects, environment and people. They have also been in use for tens of years, while mosquito population still grows.
This guide won't detail insecticide-based solutions.
